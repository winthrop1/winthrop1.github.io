Project repo: singapore-economic-stress-monitor.\n\n\n\nSingapore Economic Stress Score time series with amber and red thresholds.\n\n\n\n\n\nA monthly composite stress score (0-100) across more than 30 years\nAmber and red thresholds to mark higher-risk regimes\nA labeled latest value to make the current level easy to read\n\n\n\n\nI created this visualization to summarize economic stress in one view instead of checking multiple indicators separately. The time series shows how stress moves through different periods, which makes it easier to spot spikes and calm stretches. Adding the shaded threshold bands helps non-technical readers interpret the score quickly. The callout on the latest value makes the chart useful as a quick status check.\n\n\n\n\nWhy a line chart: time is continuous, so a line best shows trend and volatility across months.\nWhy thresholds and shading: they provide a clear, visual reference for what counts as moderate vs. high stress.\nWhy annotation: highlighting the latest point directs attention to the most actionable value."
