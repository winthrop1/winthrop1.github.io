## Singapore Economic Stress Score (Time Series)

This project visualizes a composite economic stress score for Singapore from
1993-12 to 2025-04. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with amber (40) and red (65)
thresholds to signal elevated stress. Project repo:

### What the visualization shows

- A monthly composite stress score (0-100) across more than 30 years
- Amber and red thresholds to mark higher-risk regimes
- A labeled latest value to make the current level easy to read

### Story behind the task

I created this visualization to summarize economic stress in one view instead
of checking multiple indicators separately. The time series shows how stress
moves through different periods, which makes it easier to spot spikes and calm
stretches. Adding the shaded threshold bands helps non-technical readers
interpret the score quickly. The callout on the latest value makes the chart
useful as a quick status check.

### Rationale for the chart type

- **Why a line chart:** time is continuous, so a line best shows trend and
  volatility across months.
- **Why thresholds and shading:** they provide a clear, visual reference for
  what counts as moderate vs. high stress.
- **Why annotation:** highlighting the latest point directs attention to the
  most actionable value.
