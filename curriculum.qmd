## Modules I enjoyed

This page shares a few modules that shaped how I think about data and problem
solving. I picked these because they were hands-on and gave me confidence to
work with real datasets.

### Core modules

- **AAI1001 Data Engineering and Visualization**: data cleaning, pipelines, and
  telling stories with charts
- **Programming Fundamentals**: building logic with Python and testing small
  programs
- **Statistics for Data**: interpreting distributions and making simple
  inferences

### One mini‑project example

I built a small dashboard to compare weekly study time across modules. It helped
me see which classes were taking the most effort and adjust my schedule.
