## Thyeshan Ecommerce

This final year project is an e-commerce web application prototype. I used it
to practice the full flow of an online store and to understand how different
parts of a web app connect into one user journey.

### Focus of the project

- Design a clear shopping flow from browsing to checkout
- Organize product and order information in a structured way
- Keep the interface simple and easy to navigate

### What I learned

> Building a project end-to-end taught me how small design decisions affect the
> overall user experience.
