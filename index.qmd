## Hi, I'm Winthrop

I am a Year 1 student studying AAI1001 (Data Engineering and Visualization) in Applied Computing (Fintech). I enjoy
learning how data moves from raw sources to clear stories and dashboards.

### A quick snapshot

- **Interests:** data cleaning, visualization, and simple automation
- **Current focus:** building neat, readable dashboards for class projects
- **Goal:** become confident at turning messy data into useful insights
